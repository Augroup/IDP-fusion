Njun_limit = 10
# This is the maximum number of junctions to be considered

# isoforms present. Isoform candidates extended by more 
# junctions than this limit will be excluded.

Niso_limit = 20
# The maximum number of Isoform candidates to be considered

LR_gpd_pathfilename =  
# The genepred alignment of the long reads.  This is not
# used in IDP-fusion when fusion detection is enabled,
# so it will generally be left blank.  The PSL file which
# is created before the gpd file is more useful for
# determining possible fusions.  This file could be
# helpful if you were running without fusion detection
# and you wanted to skip PSL file processing.

# These annotations include the largest number of observed pairs of fusion
# splices possible from public databases.  Pairs of splices not found in these
